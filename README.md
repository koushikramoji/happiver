SUBMISSION NAME :

Project " HAPPIVER "

SHORT DESCRIPTION :

Happiver is a machine/device which
avoid river water contaimination 

LONG DESCRIPTION:


WATER is an essential part of our life and is vital for the environmental sustainability. It plays a major part in our everyday life. It carries out processes in our body such as flushing waste from the body, regulating body temperature, transportation of nutrients and in digestion. No wonder it is "essential!"
Plain water is the best choice for keeping our bodies hydrated.
Apart from the beneficiaries of water to our body ,water has played a key role in existence of life on earth. In fact, many theories suggest that early forms of life began in oceans and thrived there. With two-thirds of the earth's surface covered by water and the human body consisting of 75 percent of it, it is evidently clear that water is one of the prime elements responsible for life on earth.

Water pollution is a global problem.
Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities.
Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans,
aquifers and groundwater.
There are many reasons for water pollution.
Let us focus on main issue "River water contamination".
Water gets polluted when contaminants are brought into the natural environment thus causing Destruction of biodiversity ,Contamination of the food chain, lack of potable water, Disease, Infant mortality.

HAPPIVER is a device which holds drainage water , treat and purifies the water and process the water into the river .
Untreated sewage has harmful chemicals , heavy metals , oils and greases which contaminate the river .
Project HAPPIVER avoids the harmful chemicals , oils and separate hard materials and improves the condition of the river water.

happiver has 4 stages ... 
stage one : sewage water gets into stage 1 where the water is entred into happiver through filter sheet and strainer mesh is placed  infront of the filter , this stage works as an grease  trap  
            filter sheets stops tiny particles in water and later drops down as sludge .
stage two : the water gets air blows which helps the aerobic bacteria eliminate biological wastes 
stage three : the is been again purifed by the help of filter sheets ..
stage four : in final stage the water gets disinfectant treated with chlorine .
